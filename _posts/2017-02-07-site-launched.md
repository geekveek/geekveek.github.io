Just got around to putting this site together. I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to put all the static stuff together, so that I can use Markdowns and template languages to layout my site. I think this will help me to focus more on generating content rather than mucking around with layouts and stuff.

I expect this blog to be about my whatever I picked up and found useful while learning more about web development. I expect this to be more of a reflective blog, where I can look back and see how far I've travelled through the journey of discovery. Also, I'm hoping others would be able to find it useful, and I can perhaps use this as a reference to others who may have encountered the same challenges that I have.
