title: Victor Chan's Reading List
---
<h1>📚{{ page.title }}📚</h1>
<p>I've taken the idea of making a update-to-date reading list on my github page from <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/reads">Nicolás Bevacqua</a>. These are the books that I am interested in reading. If you have any recommendations, feel free to <a href="mailto:victor.z.chan@gmail.com">drop me an email.</a></p>
